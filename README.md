# TopdownGame

A prototype for a top-down game with a tile-based world. Includes a custom pathfinding algorithm, which was the main focus when I started this project.

Made in C++20 with the SDL and SDL_image libraries.

I put this project here to showcase my programming.

I'll add some videos here and a downloadable executable soon.
